# NeoVim Configuration folder (nvim)

This is a repo containing base configuration files for NeoVim. At the moment, current version is 0.10.

The setup contains settings for the following plugins, beyond the standard configuration:

* Packer, package manager
* Telescope, fuzzy finder
* Treesitter, syntax highlighting, 
* Harpoon, by the one and only... The Primeagen!
* Undotree, a tree that Undoes...
* Fugitive, Git integration

Credit due to the respective package and plugin creators, of course.
This configuration was totally based on videos posted on Youtube by the Primeagen, so credit goes entirely to him.
